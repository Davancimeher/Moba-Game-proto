This repository contains the source code and assets for a prototype mobile MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) game similar to Mobile Legends. The project is built using Unity and utilizes the Photon Networking framework for multiplayer functionality.

## Description
The goal of this project is to create a basic prototype of a MOBA game that runs on mobile devices.

The core gameplay mechanics include selecting heroes, controlling units, battling enemy players, and destroying the opposing team's base.

**Please note that this project is unfinished and intended as a prototype to demonstrate gameplay mechanics and network integration.**

## Features
- Hero selection: Players can choose from a variety of heroes, each with unique abilities and playstyles.
- Online multiplayer: Connect with other players in real-time matches using Photon Networking.
- Skill system: Heroes have different skills and abilities that can be upgraded throughout the match.
- Tower defense: Protect your team's base while attempting to destroy the enemy's base.
- UI and HUD: Includes a user-friendly interface with essential information for players.
